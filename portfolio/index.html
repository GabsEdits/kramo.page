    <h2>Interactions and Animation</h2>
    <p>
        I believe that the smallest interactions can make a product feel natural
        and alive. I strive towards creating immersive experiences for the user
        without distracting them.

        Video Player, codenamed “Showtime” was designed to replace the previous
        default video player in GNOME. It was designed to be familiar to users
        of the existing project, with

        based on its design. After discussions regarding similar styling across
        the ecosystem, I decided to give the project its own vidual identity,
        retaining a friendly, user-centered experience.

        The first significant project whose design I was responsible to lead. It
        taught me how to apply the skills that I had learned by creating
        prototypes and making smaller contributions to create a wholistic
        experience. I have learned how to closely work within a comprehensive
        design system and successfully apply it to a specific use case.

        A project I had taken on to learn how to craft my own design system and
        build a product straight from scratch. I decided to go with a friendly
        but professional look and feel to fit the target audience. I designed
        the user interface, as well as all of its icons with this philosophy in
        mind. Through user testing and feedback, I have succeeded in creating a
        friendly photo editing experience that I am still iterating on.

        I have designed icons from symbolics and app icons to even emoji. You
